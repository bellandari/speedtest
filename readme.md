## SpeedTest

This is a speed test script I wrote more for the learning experience. 

It uses Folium to generate maps that show where the server used is located. Other than for visual representation, the map isn't much use. 

The script will create a JSON file with all the testing information. My plan is to use these JSON files in order to track internet speed trends for my system over the course of a few months. I'll probably upload this script to a Raspberry Pi and have it auto run a few times a day. 

Maybe. 

I don't know. Doing things to learn, really.
